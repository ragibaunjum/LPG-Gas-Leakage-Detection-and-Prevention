# LPG-Gas-Lekage-Detection-and-Prevention
 Abstract: Due to its dense population, Bangladesh is in constant danger of household fires, especially in urban areas. Gas leakages or 
 leaving the stove accidentally turned on can cause build up of gas, which can lead to fatal fire incidents. To minimize the risk of
such hazards, our project proposes a digital system to ensure kitchen safety. The system detects the gas level by using LPG gas 
sensor(MQ6) and turning the gas stove off if the gas level exceeds a threshold level. Additionally, the system detects the presence of
human and fire incidents by image processing using AWS server. A message will be sent to the user via GSM module (SIM808) to notify them 
about the gas leakage incident if there is no human present in the kitchen. Otherwise, they are warned with an alarm. As an additional 
safety measure in case the system detects a fire, a water sprinkler is also added to extinguish the fire. A prototype of the proposed 
system was tested and the results show that this system proves to be an affordable solution to improve kitchen safety for all households.
